## Bookshelf App
This simple single-page application helps us organize our books into three main categories, **Current Reading**, **Wanting** to **Read and Read**.

Seeking the best performance and best user experience when using this application, it was developed using the **Single Page Application** policies.

Using the framework **React.js** I made the page simple and dynamic, where the user can change the book of a category (in the case I called the *shelf* to become more realistic) dynamically without having to reload the entire page.

And it also has a **search** field for new books to add to your bookshelves.
